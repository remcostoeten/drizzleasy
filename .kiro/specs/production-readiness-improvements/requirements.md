# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving Drizzleasy's production readiness by addressing critical issues that could impact developers building small CRUD applications. The focus is on enhancing reliability, developer experience, and preventing common pitfalls that beginners might encounter when using the library in production environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Connection Management and Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer deploying a small CRUD app, I want reliable database connections that handle edge cases gracefully, so that my application doesn't crash or behave unexpectedly in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a database connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with actionable guidance
2. WHEN connection pooling limits are reached THEN the system SHALL queue requests gracefully with timeout handling
3. WHEN environment variables are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL fail fast with descriptive error messages
4. WHEN the database is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
5. WHEN multiple database connections are configured THEN the system SHALL validate all connections at startup
6. WHEN connection strings contain sensitive data THEN the system SHALL sanitize error messages to prevent credential leakage

### Requirement 2: Schema Validation and Type Safety

**User Story:** As a developer using TypeScript, I want comprehensive schema validation and type safety, so that I catch errors at development time rather than runtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN schema files cannot be loaded THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which files are missing or invalid
2. WHEN table names don't match the schema THEN the system SHALL suggest similar table names to help with typos
3. WHEN field names in queries don't exist THEN the system SHALL provide compile-time errors with available field suggestions
4. WHEN data types don't match schema expectations THEN the system SHALL validate and provide specific field-level error messages
5. WHEN required fields are missing in create operations THEN the system SHALL list all missing required fields
6. WHEN schema changes occur THEN the system SHALL detect and warn about potential breaking changes

### Requirement 3: ID Generation and Primary Key Handling

**User Story:** As a developer creating records, I want predictable and reliable ID generation that works across different database types, so that I don't encounter ID conflicts or generation failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating records without specifying an ID THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate IDs based on the field type
2. WHEN using auto-increment fields THEN the system SHALL not attempt to generate IDs manually
3. WHEN using UUID fields THEN the system SHALL generate valid UUIDs by default
4. WHEN using custom ID strategies THEN the system SHALL validate the strategy configuration at startup
5. WHEN ID generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
6. WHEN composite primary keys are used THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately or provide clear unsupported feature messages

### Requirement 4: Query Performance and Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer building a small app, I want queries to perform well by default without requiring deep database knowledge, so that my application remains responsive as data grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing read operations without limits THEN the system SHALL warn about potential performance issues
2. WHEN using pagination THEN the system SHALL implement efficient offset/cursor-based pagination
3. WHEN building complex WHERE clauses THEN the system SHALL optimize query generation
4. WHEN performing bulk operations THEN the system SHALL use batch processing where possible
5. WHEN queries are slow THEN the system SHALL provide query timing information in development mode
6. WHEN N+1 query patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL warn developers about potential performance issues

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer debugging issues, I want clear, actionable error messages that help me understand and fix problems quickly, so that I can resolve issues without extensive troubleshooting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL categorize errors (validation, permission, network, etc.)
2. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide field-specific error messages
3. WHEN constraint violations happen THEN the system SHALL translate database errors into user-friendly messages
4. WHEN operations timeout THEN the system SHALL distinguish between network and database timeouts
5. WHEN in development mode THEN the system SHALL provide detailed debugging information
6. WHEN in production mode THEN the system SHALL log errors appropriately while sanitizing sensitive data

### Requirement 6: Transaction Support and Data Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer performing related operations, I want transaction support to ensure data consistency, so that my application maintains data integrity even when operations fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing multiple related operations THEN the system SHALL provide transaction wrapper functions
2. WHEN a transaction fails THEN the system SHALL rollback all changes automatically
3. WHEN nested transactions are attempted THEN the system SHALL handle savepoints appropriately
4. WHEN transaction deadlocks occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with backoff
5. WHEN transactions are left open THEN the system SHALL provide warnings and automatic cleanup
6. WHEN concurrent modifications happen THEN the system SHALL detect and handle optimistic locking conflicts

### Requirement 7: Environment and Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer deploying to different environments, I want robust configuration management that prevents common deployment issues, so that my application works consistently across development, staging, and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup instructions
2. WHEN switching between environments THEN the system SHALL validate configuration compatibility
3. WHEN using different database providers THEN the system SHALL handle provider-specific configurations
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL validate changes before applying them
5. WHEN sensitive configuration is used THEN the system SHALL provide secure handling guidelines
6. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL fail fast with specific validation errors

### Requirement 8: Migration and Schema Evolution Support

**User Story:** As a developer evolving my application, I want guidance on schema changes and migrations, so that I can update my database structure without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN schema changes are detected THEN the system SHALL provide migration guidance
2. WHEN breaking changes are introduced THEN the system SHALL warn about potential data loss
3. WHEN field types change THEN the system SHALL validate data compatibility
4. WHEN tables are renamed THEN the system SHALL provide migration suggestions
5. WHEN indexes are needed THEN the system SHALL suggest performance optimizations
6. WHEN schema validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step resolution guidance
