description: What Drizzleasy supports today and what’s out-of-scope.
---

  - React 18 or 19
  - Drizzle ORM ^0.44.0
  - ESM and CJS usage
- Features
  - Typed CRUD helpers and factories
  - Natural WHERE operators (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `!`, contains/startsWith/endsWith, IN arrays)
  - Consistent result shape: `{ data?, error? }`
  - Optimistic React hook and transition helper
  - Production utilities (error handling, performance metrics, environment helpers)

## Not (yet) supported / Out-of-scope

- Client-side database access (use server actions)
- Auto-generated REST API routes (use server actions directly)
- Migrations (use Drizzle Kit)
- Advanced SQL composition helpers (joins, group by, order by)
- OR conditions in `.where()` chains (chaining combines with AND); use Drizzle directly for complex filters
- Pagination helpers; use Drizzle directly or wrap your own
- Transaction helpers; use Drizzle’s transaction API

## Philosophy

Drizzleasy aims to be a tiny helper layer you can adopt incrementally. It shouldn’t limit what you can do with Drizzle — it just removes friction for the 80% cases and stays out of the way for the rest.
