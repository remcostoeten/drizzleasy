<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion title="Why Drizzleasy over using Drizzle directly?">
    For common CRUD + simple filtering, Drizzleasy removes ceremony and gives you a consistent result shape and typed factories.
    For anything advanced (joins, transactions, pagination) you can and should drop down to Drizzle — no lock-in.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are multiple .where() calls combined?">
    They are combined with AND. OR queries are out of scope — use Drizzle for complex filters.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does Drizzleasy support pagination, sorting, joins, and transactions?">
    Not yet. Use Drizzle directly for these. Drizzleasy is a helper layer, not a query builder.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does Drizzleasy work without Drizzle Kit?">
Yes. Drizzle Kit is recommended for schema management, but `configure(db, schema)` works with any provided Drizzle schema object.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Where should I run CRUD code?">
    In Next.js, run CRUD inside server actions or server-only modules. Do not access the database on the client.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are errors returned?">
Every operation returns `{ data?, error? }`. No exceptions are thrown from CRUD helpers. You can throw your own errors if desired.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What does destroy() return?">
It returns the deleted rows (via `returning()`), same as `create()` and `update()`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I filter records?">
Use natural WHERE syntax like `age: '>18'`, `name: '*john*'`, arrays for IN, and `!value` for not equal. See WHERE Clauses.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I connect to Turso?">
Use `initializeConnection(url, { authToken })` or set `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` in the environment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What versions are supported?">
    Node.js 18+, Next.js 14 or 15, React 18 or 19, Drizzle ORM ^0.44.0
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does it work with ESM and CJS?">
    Yes, both import and require are supported.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I mix Drizzleasy with raw Drizzle queries?">
    Absolutely. Use Drizzleasy when it makes sense and drop to Drizzle for everything else.
  </Accordion>
