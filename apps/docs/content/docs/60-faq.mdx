## Does Drizzleasy work without Drizzle Kit?

Yes. Drizzle Kit is recommended for schema management, but `configure(db, schema)` works with any provided Drizzle schema object.

## Where should I run CRUD code?

- In Next.js, run CRUD inside server actions or server-only modules
- Do not access the database on the client

## How are errors returned?

Every operation returns `{ data?, error? }`. No exceptions are thrown from CRUD helpers. You can throw your own errors if desired.

## How do I filter records?

Use natural WHERE syntax like `age: '>18'`, `name: '*john*'`, arrays for IN, and `!value` for not equal. See WHERE Clauses.

## How do I connect to Turso?

Use `initializeConnection(url, { authToken })` or set `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` in the environment.
