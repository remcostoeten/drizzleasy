## Why Drizzleasy over using Drizzle directly?

For common CRUD + simple filtering, Drizzleasy removes ceremony and gives you a consistent result shape and typed factories. For anything advanced (joins, transactions, pagination) you can and should drop down to Drizzle — no lock-in.

## How are multiple `.where()` calls combined?

They are combined with AND. OR queries are out of scope — use Drizzle for complex filters.

## Does Drizzleasy support pagination, sorting, joins, and transactions?

Not yet. Use Drizzle directly for these. Drizzleasy is a helper layer, not a query builder.

## Does Drizzleasy work without Drizzle Kit?

Yes. Drizzle Kit is recommended for schema management, but `configure(db, schema)` works with any provided Drizzle schema object.

## Where should I run CRUD code?

- In Next.js, run CRUD inside server actions or server-only modules
- Do not access the database on the client

## How are errors returned?

Every operation returns `{ data?, error? }`. No exceptions are thrown from CRUD helpers. You can throw your own errors if desired.

## What does `destroy()` return?

It returns the deleted rows (via `returning()`), same as `create()` and `update()`.

## How do I filter records?

Use natural WHERE syntax like `age: '>18'`, `name: '*john*'`, arrays for IN, and `!value` for not equal. See WHERE Clauses.

## How do I connect to Turso?

Use `initializeConnection(url, { authToken })` or set `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` in the environment.

## What versions are supported?

- Node.js 18+
- Next.js 14 or 15
- React 18 or 19
- Drizzle ORM ^0.44.0

## Does it work with ESM and CJS?

Yes, both import and require are supported.

## Can I mix Drizzleasy with raw Drizzle queries?

Absolutely. Use Drizzleasy when it makes sense and drop to Drizzle for everything else.
